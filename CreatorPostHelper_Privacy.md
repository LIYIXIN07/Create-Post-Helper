(A Rigorous Data Governance Framework for Cross-Border Promotion Tool Users)

## 1. Core Principles of Data Governance
"Security, Necessity, Compliance, Empowerment" form the foundation of the Tool’s data governance: We only collect data **to the minimum extent necessary** to provide overseas short-video promotion services, protect your information with the strictest security standards, and adhere to global data protection regulations (including GDPR, CCPA, etc.)—all data use is ultimately aimed at delivering precise, secure empowerment for your cross-border promotion.


## 2. Precise Scope of Data Collection
The Tool only collects **service-essential minimized data**:
- Enterprise identity verification information (to confirm legitimate usage)
- In-Tool content draft data (to support content editing & publishing)
- Non-private operational data post-publishing (e.g., publication status, platform guideline check results)

We will never collect core enterprise data or trade secrets unrelated to the service.


## 3. Compliance & Value Boundaries of Data Use
Collected data is only used for the following scenarios:
1. Ensuring stable service operation (e.g., identity verification, technical support for content publishing workflows)
2. Optimizing your cross-border promotion experience (e.g., pushing creation recommendations tailored to overseas audience preferences)
3. Fulfilling compliance obligations (e.g., cooperating with TikTok’s compliance reviews, responding to legitimate regulatory inquiries)

We commit to never selling or renting your data to third parties; we only share **de-identified non-sensitive data** with compliant technical partners when necessary to deliver services.


## 4. End-to-End Data Security Protection
We have built a dual "technology + management" security system:
- Technical measures: Encrypted transmission, desensitized storage, hierarchical access controls
- Management processes: Strict internal data governance workflows

In the event of an unavoidable data security incident, we will notify you immediately and assist with remedial measures.


## 5. Your Data Rights & Policy Updates
- You may view or modify your enterprise verification information at any time.
- If you terminate service use, we will securely delete your relevant data after the period required by law.
- This policy will be updated in line with global data regulation changes; revisions will be notified via in-Tool announcements—continued service use constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
